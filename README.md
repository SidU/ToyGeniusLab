## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- Eleven Labs API key

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidu/toygeniuslab.git
```

### Install Requirements

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install ffmpeg
`brew install ffmpeg`

Install mpv
`brew install mpv`

## Environmental Variables Setup

Before running the project, you'll need to set up two essential environment variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ELEVEN_API_KEY`.

### Setting up OPENAI_API_KEY

1. Visit [OpenAI API Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to obtain your OpenAI API key.
2. Once you have your key, set it as an environment variable. On Unix-based systems, you can use the following command:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
    On Windows, you can set it through the command prompt:
    ```bash
    set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
    ```

### Setting up ELEVEN_API_KEY

1. To get the Eleven API key, follow the guide available at [Eleven Labs Documentation](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/introduction).
2. Similar to the OpenAI API key, set the Eleven API key as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    # On Unix-based systems
    export ELEVEN_API_KEY="your-eleven-api-key-here"
    ```
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    set ELEVEN_API_KEY=your-eleven-api-key-here
    ```

Now you're ready to run the project with both API keys set up.

### Running a pet
```bash
python pet.py petergriffin.yaml
```

### Connecting Bluetooth Microphone and Speaker

Before running the project, make sure you have a portable Bluetooth microphone and speaker connected to your computer. Ensure that they are selected as the default input and output devices. For best experience, we recommend purchasing a mini bluetooth speaker/mic combo, like [LEICEX Mini Speaker from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LEICEX-Bluetooth-Portable-Wireless-Speakers/dp/B0BPNYY61M/) (costs ~$10).

#### Steps to Connect

1. Connect your Bluetooth microphone and speaker to your computer following the manufacturer's instructions.
  
2. **On Windows:**
    - Right-click on the Speaker icon in the taskbar and select "Open Sound settings."
    - Under the "Input" section, select your Bluetooth microphone from the dropdown.
    - Under the "Output" section, select your Bluetooth speaker from the dropdown.
  
3. **On macOS:**
    - Open "System Preferences" and click on "Sound."
    - Go to the "Input" tab and select your Bluetooth microphone.
    - Go to the "Output" tab and select your Bluetooth speaker.

By ensuring these settings, you'll get the optimal audio experience while interacting with the project.

## Bringing Your Mario AI Toy to Life
1. Download and print the [Mario template](https://www.cubeecraft.com/cubees/new-mario).
2. After pairing a Bluetooth speaker/microphone with your computer, insert it into the paper toy.
3. Execute the AI toy program by running python `pet.py mario.yaml` in your terminal. Get ready for interactive fun!

## Crafting Your Custom AI Toy
1. Begin with downloading the [blank template](https://cubeecraft-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/about_downloads_cubeecraft_template.pdf.zip). You can digitally color it or use markers and crayons for a hands-on approach. You can also grab a slightly edited version of it [from our repo here](blank_template.png) (has a blank face for more creative options).
2. Insert a Bluetooth speaker/microphone into your custom-designed toy, ensuring it's paired with your computer first.
3. Make a copy of an existing toy's config by running `cp mario.yaml mytoy.yaml`.
4. Update the `system_prompt` property in `mytoy.yaml` according to the personality you want your toy to have.
5. Optionally, update the `voice_id` property in `mytoy.yaml` with the value of the voice you'd like your toy to have from [ElevenLabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-library).
6. Activate your AI toy by executing python `pet.py mytoy.yaml` in your terminal. Enjoy your creation's company!
